Plot: 

Illegal move ratio (rolling) 
Action types relative (rolling) 
Skip move ratio (rolling) 
STD of territory index sources (rolling)
-- Is the Agent choosing from a vibrant range of sources? 
STD of territory desttination sources (rolling) 
-- Is the Agent choosing from a vibrant range of targets? 


1: make function in environment more modular  
2: improve plotting 
3: error testing 
4: implement action masking 



total_moves = skip_moves + attack_source + attack_target + fortify_from + fortify_to 
attack_source - (attack_skip + illegal_source)  = attack_target + illegal_target
